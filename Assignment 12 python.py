# Ans1)  The PdfFileReader() file objects should be opened in rb -> read binary mode.
# Whereas for PdfFileWriter() file objects should be opened in wb -> write binary mode.

# Ans2)PdfFileReader class provides a method called getPage(page_no) to get a page object.

# In[ ]:


# Example Code:
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader
pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file_path)
for page in pdf_reader.getNumPages():
    pdf_reader.getPage(page)


# Ans3): The getNumPages() method of PdfFileReader class stores the no pages in a PDF document.

# In[ ]:


#Example Code:

from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader
pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file_path)
print(pdf_reader.getNumPages())        # Prints the no of pages in a input document


# Ans4) If a PdfFileReader objectâ€™s PDF is encrypted with the password swordfish and you're not aware of it. first read the Pdf using the PdfFileReader Class. PdfFileReader class provides a attribute called isEncrypted to check whether a pdf is encrypted or not. the method returns true if a pdf is encrypted and vice versa.
# if pdf is encrypted use the decrypt() method provided by PdfFileReader class first then try to read the contents/pages of the pdf, else PyPDF2 will raise the following error PyPDF2.utils.PdfReadError: file has not been decrypted.

# In[ ]:


#Example Code:

from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader
pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file_path)
if pdf_reader.isEncrypted:          # to check whether the pdf is encrypted or not
    pdf_reader.decrypt("swordfish")
for page in pdf_reader.pages:
    print(page.extractText())       # to print the text data of a page from pdf


# Ans5) PyPDF2 Package provides 2 methods to rotate a page:
# 
# A)rotateClockWise() -> For Clockwise rotation.
# B)rotateCounterClockWise() -> For Counter Clockwise rotation.
# The PyPDF2 package only allows you to rotate a page in increments of 90 degrees. You will receive an AssertionError otherwise.

# Ans6)The structure of a document is represented by three different data types in python-Docx. At the highest level, a Document object represents the entire document. The Document object contains a list of Paragraph objects for the paragraphs in the document. (A new paragraph begins whenever the user presses ENTER or RETURN while typing in a Word document.) Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more Run objects.
# 
# The text in a Word document is more than just a string. It has font, size, color, and other styling information associated with it. A style in Word is a collection of these attributes. A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style. A new Run object is needed whenever the text style changes.

# Ans7)

# In[ ]:


# Example Program
from docx import Document
doc = Document("sample_file.docx") # Path of the Docx file
print(doc.paragraphs)             # Prints the list of Paragraph objects for a Document
for paragraph in doc.paragraphs:
    print(paragraph.text)        # Prints the text in the paragraph    


# Ans8)Run object has bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables. The text in a Word document is more than just a string. It has font, size, color, and other styling information associated with it.
# 
# A style in Word is a collection of these attributes. A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style. A new Run object is needed whenever the text style changes.

# Ans9)

# In[ ]:


bold = True   #Style Set to Bold
bold = False  #Style Not Set to Bold
bold = None   #Style is Not Applicable

# In[ ]:


# Example Program
from docx import Document
document = Document()
document.add_paragraph("iNeuron Full Stack DataScience Course")
document.save('mydocument.docx')


# Ans11)

# In[ ]:


# Example Program
from docx import Document
doc = Document()
doc.add_paragraph('Hello, there!')
doc.save('hello.docx')


# Ans12)The levels for a heading in a word document can be specified by using the level attribute inside the add_heading method. There are a total of 5 levels statring for 0 t0 4. where level 0 makes a headline with the horizontal line below the text, whereas the heading level 1 is the main heading. Similarly, the other headings are sub-heading with their's font-sizes in decreasing order.
