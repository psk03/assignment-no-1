# Ans1)Function advantageous to have in our program is that Functions reduce the need of Duplicate code.
# This makes program shorter,easier to read and easier to update.The function can be reused again and again.This helps to reduce time to type a program.

# Ans2)A Function is a set of code that performs a specific task and can be used whenever needed just by calling it. 

# Ans3)The def statement creates a function.
# Syntax for Function:-
#   def function_name(parameters):
# 	"""docstring"""
# 	statement(s)
# 

# Ans4)A function is a procedure to achieve a particular result.
# While Function call is using this function to achieve that task. Using a function to do a particular task any point in program is called as function call.

# An5)There is one global scope and one local scope is created whenever a function is called.

# Ans6)When a fuction is return,the local is destroyed and all variable in it are forgotten.

#  Ans7)A return value is the value that function call also evaluates.Like any value, a return value can be used as a part of an expression.

# Ans8)If the function doesnot have a return statement then its return value is None.

# Ans9)A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to a global variable.If you want to refer to a global variable in a function,you can use the global keyword to declare which variable are global.

# Ans10)The data type of None is NoneType.

# Ans11)The import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.

# Ans12)The function can be called with spam.bacon().

# Ans13) To save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error we have to place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause and use except block to handle error.

# Ans14):The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause. The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.
